## On the ethics of AI usages.

For this topic, i will discuss regarding how to use AI ethically, as well as to spread awareness on the overwhelmingly increasing AI usages throughout the internet as well.
First of all, i will be explaining how AI came to be, where it came from, and when exactly it got popular. Then, i will also explain the most common usages of AI (Chatbot, Video Generation, Image generation, etc), and how to ethically use them (Don't plagiarize, don't use AI to spread hoax or misinformation, etc). I will also spread awareness on how AI's content generation (Video generation, image generation, voice generation, etc) is getting scarily indistinguishable from reality, and the dangers it could pose. I will explain on steps that we can take in order to prevent this.
