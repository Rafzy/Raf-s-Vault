# Symmetry of Molecules

Many molecules have symmetrical structure,
For example H20 have the same bond length, and Benzene which we can intuitively say it's symmetrical after looking at the structure

In quantum chemistry, we need a mathematical definition for Symmetrical structures.
So how can we formally define symmetry operations.

## Symmetry operations

Operations after which the molecular structure becomes identical
Let's say we perform a rotation of 180 degree in an axis, this is called C2 operation

If we take a mirror image of the molecule, from different angles, we get the exact same shape which makes sense since it is symmetrical ($\sigma$ stands for reflection, v stands for vertical. $\sigma'$ stands for reflection that cuts all the atoms.)

If we do nothing, it's called E operation

Five types of symmetry operation

$\hat{E}$ -> Does nothing
$\hat{C_{n}}$ -> Rotation about the axis by $360 \degree/n$
$\hat{\sigma}$ -> Reflection through the plane
$\hat{i}$ -> Reflection through the center (inversion center)
$\hat{S_{n}}$ -> Rotation about the axis by $360$
