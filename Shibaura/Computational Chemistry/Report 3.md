1. What is the point group of CH2O?

	If we analyze the Structure of $CH_{2}O$, we can see the structure has a trigonal planar structure. If we want to evaluate the point group, we need to examine the symmetrical operations applicable to this structure.
	
	First of all, we can immediately tell that this structure has two reflection operations, ($\sigma_{v}$ and $\sigma'_{v}$), we can imagine the first reflection cutting through the oxygen and carbon atom, making a symmetrical reflection from left and right. And the other reflection cuts laterally, going through all the atoms.
	
	Next, we can also tell that the molecule possesses a rotation symmetry, imagine the axis going through the oxygen and carbon atom right in the middle. And if we spin the molecule $180 \degree$, the shape is the same (symmetrical), so now we know it  also possesses $\hat{C}_{2}$ rotation, and $n = 2$ since we rotate it by $180 \degree$, and $360 \degree / n$.f
	
	And i think that's all for $CH_{2}O$'s symmetry operation, and referencing last lecture's ppt,

	$CH_{2}O$ belongs in $C_{2v}$ point group

	The first orbital surrounds the Oxygen atom, the energy of this level is -20.585, and the symmetry for this orbital from the .out file is labelled $1A 1$, we can analyze the character table for $C_{2v}$ Point group to analyze the
