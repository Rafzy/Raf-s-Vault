(At SCF convergence)

{$\phi(x)$} Hartree-Fock orbitals ("Molecular" Orbitals)
{$\epsilon_{i}$} Orbital Energies

"We are solving Hartree-Fock at ground state"

We can separate the different orbitals (Occupied orbitals and Unoccupied orbitals)


## Closed-shell systems
$N_{\alpha} = N_{\beta} = \frac{N}{2}$
(We have an equal amount of alpha and beta electron spins)
Examples: He, Be, Ne, and many stable molecules

$\alpha$ and $\beta$ electrons behave identically = Same spatial orbitals

Remember that spin orbitals can be separated into the spatial coordinates, and the spin coordinates

$\phi^{\alpha}_{i} = \varphi^{\alpha}_{i}\alpha(\omega)$
$\phi^{\beta}_{i} = \varphi^{\beta}_{i}\beta(\omega)$

## Open-shell systems
