Final optimized energy: -379.266798
Nuclear repulsion energy: 278.414715 hartrees
Point group: $C_{1}$
Number of IR inactive modes: 0
Frequency of the most intense mode: 1293.44 (Mode 20 with 269.711 IR intensity)
![[image-41.png|381x174]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. 
There are several stretching between atom bonds, the single bond in the middle between the C atoms seem to stretch as the two C atoms are moving opposingly, same goes with the C atom beside the two.
The leftmost C atom seems to be stretching and bending just a slight bit, because it's moving slightly upwards, and the Oxygen atom also ever so slightly propagate downwards to the right. The hydrogen atom above the O atom bends the bond to the top left. The three H atoms also ever so slightly propagate to the right.

Energy relative to the most stable structure:
