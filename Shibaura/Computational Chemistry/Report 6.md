1. ![[image-39.png|203x201]]

Geometry in IQMol:
![[image-40.png|377x177]]

Final optimized energy: -379.266798
Nuclear repulsion energy: 278.414715 hartrees
Point group: $C_{1}$
Number of IR inactive modes: 0
Frequency of the most intense mode: 1293.44 (Mode 20 with 269.711 IR intensity)
![[image-41.png|381x174]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. 
There are several stretching between atom bonds, the single bond in the middle between the C atoms seem to stretch as the two C atoms are moving opposingly, same goes with the C atom beside the two.
The leftmost C atom seems to be stretching and bending just a slight bit, because it's moving slightly upwards, and the Oxygen atom also ever so slightly propagate downwards to the right. The hydrogen atom above the O atom bends the bond to the top left. The three H atoms also ever so slightly propagate to the right.

Final optimized energy: -379.234462
Nuclear repulsion energy: 298.913772 hartrees
Point group: $C_{1}$.
Number of inactive IR modes: 0
Frequency of most intense mode: 1188.53 (Mode 20 with 677.538 IR Intensity)
![[image-44.png|411x214]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. It seems like most of the vibration is from the stretching and bending from the single bond between the Oxygen and C atom, the C atom seems to propagate to the left and right, while the O atom seems to go right, slightly upward. We can also see both Hydrogen atom that's bonded to the single C atom also propagates to the right in phase with each other.
We can also see that the leftmost H atom and the C atom bonded to it also moves ever so slightly.

3. ![[image-45.png|187x244]]

Geometry in IQMol:
![[image-46.png|384x403]]

Final optimized energy: -379.208942
Nuclear repulsion energy: 326.851417 hartrees
Point group: $C_{s}$
Number of inactive IR modes: 0
Frequency of most intense mode: 1129.81 (Mode 18 with IR intensity of 243.312)
![[image-47.png|385x411]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. The atom with the most movement is the hydrogen that's bonded with the O atom, stretching and bending the bond downwards, left a bit. The C atom that's single bonded to the bottom O atom also propagates a little to the bottom right, while stretching the double bond to the left and single bond to the right.
The two hydrogens on the left also seems to propagate upwards, causing the two C atom that's bonded to them to also move a bit.

4. ![[image-48.png|172x258]]

Geometry in IQMol:
![[image-49.png|362x332]]

Final optimized energy: -379.340984
Nuclear repulsion energy: 320.992918 hartrees
Point group: $D_{2}h$
Number of inactive IR modes: 17
Frequency of most intense mode: 1693.18 (Mode 25 with IR intensity of 172.872)
![[image-50.png|358x318]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. The two C atoms that's doubly bonded to the two Oxygen atoms are both propagating to the bottom right, and the two O atoms are propagating to the top left, so the double bonds stretch in and out because of the opposing directions of the C and O atoms.
The four H atoms also propagate, kindof to one side of the molecule, in this case, they're kindof propagating to the down right.

After comparing all of the isomer's final optimized energy, this has the least amount of energy, thus this should be the most stable structure out of all of the isomers.


5. ![[image-51.png|183x252]]

Geometry in IQMol:
![[image-54.png|351x329]]

Final optimized energy: -379.331635
Nuclear repulsion energy: 324.463097 hartrees
Point Group: $C_{1}$
Number of inactive IR modes: 0
Frequency of most intense Mode: 1662.95 (Mode 24 with IR intensity of 105.648)

![[image-55.png|358x329]]

This is the vibrational mode of with the highest IR intensity. We can see that the two C atoms that's doubly bonded to the two O atoms move opposite of each other, the two C atoms propagate inwards to the molecule, and the two O atoms propagate outwards of the molecule, causing the two double bonds to stretch inwards and outwards.
We can also see that the two H atoms on the sides also slightly propagates upwards, bending the bond a little bit.

This is the geometry in iQMol after symmetrizing and minimizing energy using force field of MMFF94

Final optimized energy: -379.187630
Nuclear repulsion energy: 325.710872
Point group: $C_{1}$
Number of inactive IR modes: 0
Frequency of most intense mode: 2910.18 (Mode 27 with IR intensity of 134.704)

![[image-58.png|417x402]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. Seems like the only atom propagating back and forth in this mode is the one hydrogen atom at the bottom, moving kind of inwards toward the molecule.

![[image-61.png|366x366]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. most of the atoms propagate towards and outwards of the screen, if we look at the molecule kind-of face on. three all of the hydrogen atoms propagate towards the screen, along with one C atom in the top-middle. And one c atom on the top right propagates outwards from the screen.

![[image-64.png|434x410]]

This is the vibrational mode with the most IR intensity. similar to the previous isomer, we see that all of the atoms are propagating towards/outwards from the screen if we face the molecule head on. The four hydrogen propagates towards the screen, while two C atoms on the top left and bottom right propagates outwards into the screen, causing the four bonds with the H atom to bend inwards and outwards.
