# Expectation Value of Property

Properties of molecule can be described by an operator form. Like the Hamiltonian, dipole moment, etc.
Dipole moment is defined as the sum of charges $q_{i}$ with position vectors $r_{i}$

---

**Dipole moment reminder**
Dipole moment -> Measures how separated positive and negative charges are in a molecule.
$\mu = q *d$

---

Based on the above formula, we can refine dipole as

$\hat{\mu} = \sum_{i}q_{i}r_{i}$

($q_{i}=-1$ for electrons, and $q_{i} = +Z_{A}$ for nucleus A)
