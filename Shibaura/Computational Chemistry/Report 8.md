Note:
When i wanted to calculate \[Br...C(CH3)3...CN]- Transition state, my IQmol couldnt compute the result due to server timeout issues, and because my calculation exceeded the time limit from Q-Chem's public server. 
This is because the transition state is rather bulky, and despite this i will try to answer my best using the calculations that work.
