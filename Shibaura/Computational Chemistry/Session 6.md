**Spectroscopy** ->  interaction between electromagnetic radiation and atoms/molecules.

In this class, we focus on Infrared (IR) absorption

# Molecular Vibrations

Atoms in a molecule can vibrate as if the chemical bonds between them is a spring.
A molecule initially lies at an initial state, with it's wave function $\ket{\Psi_{i}}$ with energy $E_{i}$.
There are different states with differing energy levels (discrete, not continuous). Quantum mechanics indicate that molecules can absorb light as energy, causing them to jump to a higher energy state ($\ket{\Psi_{f}}$ with $E_{f}$).
This happens when the energy of light $hv$ matches the energy difference between the states $\Delta E = E_{f} - E_{i}$.
If it doesn't match, then the light is reflected or transmitted.
Alternatively as well, a higher energy state molecule can emit light with energy $hv$ to relax to the lower energy state.
