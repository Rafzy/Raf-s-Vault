**Spectroscopy** ->  interaction between electromagnetic radiation and atoms/molecules.

In this class, we focus on Infrared (IR) absorption

# Molecular Vibrations

Atoms in a molecule can vibrate as if the chemical bonds between them is a spring.
A molecule initially lies at an initial state, with it's wave function $\ket{\Psi_{i}}$ with energy $E_{i}$.
There are different states with differing energy levels (discrete, not continuous). Quantum mechanics indicate that molecules can absorb light as energy, causing them to jump to a higher energy state ($\ket{\Psi_{f}}$ with $E_{f}$).
This happens when the energy of light $hv$ matches the energy difference between the states $\Delta E = E_{f} - E_{i}$.
If it doesn't match, then the light is reflected or transmitted.
Alternatively as well, a higher energy state molecule can emit light with energy $hv$ to relax to the lower energy state.

To specify a molecule with N atom's configuration in space, we need $3N$ coordinates (x, y, z) coordinates for each atom which corresponds to 3N degrees of freedom, attributed to **translational motion**.
Same with **rotation** of a molecule demands three degrees of freedom, except for linear molecules
So, total degrees of freedom corresponding to **vibrational motion**:
- $3N-6$
- $3N-5$ for linear molecules

In the absence of an external field, the energy of a molecule does not depend on the translation or rotation.
Potential energy $V$ of a polyatomic molecule becomes a function of $3N-5$ or $3N-6$ **vibrational coordinates** -> $q_{1},q_{2},\dots,q_{N_{vib}}$
$N_{vib}$ = $3N-5$ or $3N-6$

$$
V = V(q_{1},q_{2},\dots,q_{N_{vib}})
$$

Expanding the function around the equilibrium geometry q=0

$$
V(q_{1},q_{2},\dots, q_{N_{vib}})=V(0,0,\dots,0)+ \sum_{i=1}^{N_{vib}}(\partial)
$$
