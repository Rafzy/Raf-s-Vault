Alpha 41 (HOMO) orbital:
![[image-89.png|491x266]]

Seems to be a bonding $\pi$ orbital, there are several C-C bonds with the same signs.

Alpha 42 (LUMO) orbital:
![[image-90.png|496x280]]
 
This seems to be an antibonding $\pi^{*}$ orbital, there are nodes between carbon atoms.

Since for the tripled excited state, the electron jumps from Alpha 41 to Alpha 42, the Alpha will lose some electrons, and since there there are carbon atoms that are in phase with each other, creating a bonding orbital, carbons with the same phase will weaken the bond, thus lengthening.
Looking at the other side, Alpha 42 will gain electron, and since this is an antibonding orbital observed by differing signs between carbon bonds, will cause it to further weaken the bond, thus further lengthening the bonds between carbon atoms with different signs.

**Geometry optimization for triplet**
First thing we noticed is that the structure became planar, instead of a non planar structure.

We can also observe that our guess before was correct, the bonding between atoms became longer than that of the optimized singlet structure. This can be explained by observing the singlet structure's HOMO orbital, each phase of the orbital kind of spirals around the structure, which would explain why this molecule would have a non-planar structure to it. Meanwhile, the LUMO orbital doesn't exhibit that property.

For example, the bond between these two atom bonds became longer by around 0.07 Angstrom

Alpha 34 (HOMO)
![[image-96.png|460x350]]

Here, we can see that this is a bonding$\pi$ orbital, adjacent C bonding create bonding orbitals, dibided into several orbitals of the structure.

Alpha 35 (LUMO)
![[image-97.png|463x344]]

For LUMO, we can see that this is bonding forms an antibonding $\pi^{*}$ orbital, we can see nodes between C bondings, except for the two leftmost and rightmost C pair.

So, from what we can see, my prediction is that the general bonding length will lengthen when transitioning into an excited triplet state, same case with biphenyl, however we might see mixed effects for the peripheral C-C bond in the middle, because there's no apparent change that might happen between HOMO and LUMO as of now.

By the naked eye, there doesn't seem to be much change, but if we analyze the length of the C bonds, we can see that the triplet structure has longer bonds

Triplet:
![[image-100.png|510x360]]

Singlet:
![[image-101.png|503x403]]

As we can see, for the C bonds it's longer for the triplet state compared to the singlet state by around 0.07 angstrom. proving the previous prediction. Now, let's examine the C bond in the middle to see the effect, since i couldn't make a clear prediction before

Triplet:
![[image-102.png|506x368]]

Singlet:
![[image-103.png|509x381]]

So it seems that the C-C bond in the middle also increases in length, but not as drastic as the other C-C bonds

Plot:
Alpha 53 (HOMO)
![[image-106.png|515x463]]

This seems to be also a bonding $\pi$ orbital, we can see that there the Molecular orbital is comprised of in phase orbitals that surrounds most of the bond between C atoms.

Alpha 54 (LUMO)
![[image-107.png|519x394]]

For the LUMO orbital, we can see that it's a antibonding $\pi^{*}$ orbital, since we can see a lot more nodes in between most of the C bondings.

So my prediction is the same as before, because the electrons move from HOMO, a bonding MO, to LUMO, an antibonding MO, the length of the bonds would generally lengthen.

Same with naphthelene, the geometry optimization for the triplet structure doesn't seem to change to the naked eye. But we can observe the exact change in length between triplet structure and singlet structure
