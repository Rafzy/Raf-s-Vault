Most dominant: D(41) --> V(1) amplitude = 0.8474
Plot:
Alpha 41 (HOMO) orbital:
![[image-89.png|491x266]]

Seems to be a bonding $\pi$ orbital, there are several C-C bonds with the same signs.

Alpha 42 (LUMO) orbital:

This seems to be an antibonding $\pi^{*}$ orbital, there are nodes between carbon atoms.

Since for the tripled excited state, the electron jumps from Alpha 41 to Alpha 42, the Alpha will lose some electrons, and since there there are carbon atoms that are in phase with each other, creating a bonding orbital, carbons with the same phase will weaken the bond, thus lengthening.
Looking at the other side, Alpha 42 will gain electron, and since this is an antibonding orbital observed by differing signs between carbon bonds, will cause it to further weaken the bond, thus further lengthening the bonds between carbon atoms with different signs.
