Most dominant: D(41) --> V(1) amplitude = 0.8474
Plot:
Alpha 41 (HOMO) orbital:

Seems to be a bonding $\pi$ orbital, there are several C-C bonds with the same signs.

Alpha 42 (LUMO) orbital:

This seems to be an antibonding $\pi^{*}$ orbital, there are nodes between carbon atoms.

Since for the tripled excited state, the electron jumps from Alpha 41 to Alpha 42, the Alpha will lose some electrons, and since there there are carbon atoms that are in phase with each other, creating a bonding orbital, carbons with the same phase will weaken the bond, thus lengthening.
Looking at the other side, Alpha 42 will gain electron, and since this is an antibonding orbital observed by differing signs between carbon bonds, will cause it to further weaken the bond, thus further lengthening the bonds between carbon atoms with different signs.

**Geometry optimization for triplet**
First thing we noticed is that the structure became planar, instead of a non planar structure.

We can also observe that our guess before was correct, the bonding between atoms became longer than that of the optimized singlet structure. This can be explained by observing the singlet structure's HOMO orbital, each phase of the orbital kind of spirals around the structure, which would explain why this molecule would have a non-planar structure to it. Meanwhile, the LUMO orbital doesn't exhibit that property.

Singlet:

For example, the bond between these two atom bonds became longer by around 0.07 Angstrom

Singlet energy at optimized triplet energy: -463.01296690
