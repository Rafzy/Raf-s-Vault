	**MO #1**

	For the first Molecular orbital, it seems to follow only the O's atomic orbital, this makes sense since in the IQMol, we can see that for MO#1, 1s of O has the highest MO coefficient (-0.99468), meaning, that orbital is the highest contributor for forming the Molecular Orbital.

	**MO #2**

	For the second MO, we can see that the orbital surrounds the three atoms, and from this we can infer that this is a bonding orbital, since we don't see any nodes between atoms. This is also supported when we analyze the MO coefficients for MO#2, we see that the Coefficients that contribute to forming the MO all has negative sign, (-0.47705 for 1s orbital of O, and -0.12372 for 1s orbital of H, and some other orbitals),

	 this means it means the wavefunction from the AO forms an "in-phase" Molecular orbital, forming a bonding orbital. We also know that bonding orbitals release energy since it should be lower energy.
	
	**MO #3**

	For MO #3, we can see what appears to be an antibond orbital, since we a node is visible. But it's interesting that the node splits right in the middle of the O atom, dividing the two H atoms. This may be explained when we analyze the MO coefficients from the result.

	(The final four rows are for H orbitals)
	We can see that for the H orbital, there are two negative, and two positive coefficients. These two would together form antibonding orbital, which would explain why the node separates between the two Hydrogen. Other than that, if we also look at the Oxygen atom's coefficient, we can see that there are two major positive coefficients (0.50196 and 0.31249), as well as two somewhat major negative coefficients (-0.22739 and -0.11940), and the two AO with positive coefficients may have formed a bonding orbital with one Hydrogen atom, and the two AO with negative coefficients forms a bonding orbital with the other.
	This may explain why it looks like a bonding orbital for each H with half of the O atom.
	
	**MO #4**

	For the fourth orbital, we can see that it is an antibonding orbital between the two Hydrogen atoms, and the Oxygen atom. So the node, splits between the Oxygen and the two hydrogens. Let's analyze the output again :D
