# What is Operating System?

## Components of computer systems

- Hardware -> provides basic resources
- Application program -> Solve problems/tasks using system resources
- User -> Solve it's own problem using compilers


**Operating System** -> Software system that bridges application program and hardware

Roles of OS:
- Resource management
	- Hardware: CPU, memory, I/O
	- Software: Program, Data
	- Purpose:
		- Control shared resources
		- Adequate access from each application
- Control Program
	- Manages user program
	- Manage hardware resources (?)
	- Ensures CPU is being used 100% of the time
	- Guarantees reliability
