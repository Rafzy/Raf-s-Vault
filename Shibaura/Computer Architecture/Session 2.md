	# Computer Internals

Computer's main components are divided into five parts:
- Input (From the outside world, eg: Mouse, Keyboard, sensors, etc)
- Output device (To the outside world, eg: Monitor, speaker, etc)
- Memory (Important because of the speed difference between cpu and I/O)
- Control (Main component of CPU, To control the calculations, like reading the next instructions for the cpu to operate)
- Datapath (Main component of CPU, Used to calculate data eg: Addition, subtraction, etc)



# CPU Manufacturing

## Chip (Semiconductor chip)

- Made out of silicon (It's used because really cheap, the material is included in sand (SiO2))
- Semiconductor -> The resistivity is just enough for it to be both a conductor and insulator under certain circumstances
- Called "Intergrated Circuit" or (LSI)
	- Switch element (MOS transistor) is integrated on the chip
- Leading companies for chips:
	- TSMC (Leading)
	- Samsung
	- Intel


**The numbers of elements manufactured on a chip**
For both DRAM and CPU chips, The number of elements manufactured inside a chip increases exponentially each year.

>"The number of elements on an integrated
circuit continues to increase at a rate of
four times every three years"
Dr. G.Moore

This trend then is pronounced as **Moore's law**

Elements have been able to be made smaller via "Micro-fabrication technology"

**Chip Manufacturing process**

1. Silicon ingot (Shaped like a sausage) is acquired (99.9999999999% purity)
2. It then gets sliced into wafers (Blank)
3. Then each of the wafer gets processed to patterned wafers, each pattern inside the wafer is a semiconductor chip
4. It's then tested to check which chip works and which doesn't
5. the tested wafer goes through a dicer and gets cut for each pattern square called dies
6. We then bond each die into one package, then gets tested again before shipping to customers



**Yield**
- Proportion of working chips per wafer (Not all chips are guaranteed to work per one wafer)
