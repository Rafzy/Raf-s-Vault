## Definition
Mechatronics -> smart machine design that integrates electronics and software design with traditional machine design

Mechatronics = ME (Mechanical) + EE (Electrical) + CS (Computer Science)

## Electrical circuits in mechatronics
Purpose of electrical circuits:
- Sensing/signal conditioning -> Uses voltage 
- Power/Actuator driving -> Uses current
- Communication/Pulse handling -> Digital signals
- Amplification/Sensor handling -> Analog signals


## Basic Electrical concepts

### Currents (I)
Flow of electron in a circuit loop
Formula:
$$
I=\frac{dQ}{dt}
$$
(Change in charge over time)

Unit: Amperes \[A] or Coulombs/second \[C/s]
==Important: Current flows in the opposite of electron movement (Electrons are negative)==
Current only flows in complete circuits

### Voltage (V)
Potential difference between two nodes
Good analogy: Height difference in gravitational field
Unit: Volt \[V]
Water analogy:
Voltage -> Water pressure
Current -> Water flow


## Basic Circuit law

### Ohm's law
Formula:
$$
V = IR
$$
==This defines ideal resistance; ==
