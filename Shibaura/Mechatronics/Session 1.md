# Intro to Electric Circuits and Diagram

Starter kits:
- Freenove starter kit
- Super starter kit UNO R3 Project Elegoo

Also get:
- PNP Transistor
- Jumpwire kit
- Multimeter (DCV+ $\ohm$)
- Small flathead screwdriver (To pry off some parts)


## What is Mechatronics?

>Machines integrating electronic and software design to mechanical design

Cool formula gimmick:
*Mechatronics* = *Design (M, EE, CS)*
M -> Mechanics
EE -> Electronic Engineering
CS -> Computer Science yay

*Building a Controller is the main goal of mechatronics*

# Intro to Electrical Circuits

- Voltage (V) / Current (I)
	- Sensing/Signal conditioning: Voltage
	- Power/Actuator Driving: Current
- Analog / Digital
	- Communication, pulse handling: Digital
	- Amplification, sensor handling: Analog


**Current**
- Currents must flow on a circuit (Loop)
- Currents are the *Average* movements of electron $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$
- Unit: A = C/s
	- C: Coulomb (10.36)

**Voltage**
- Potential difference that exists between two nodes
- Potential in an electric field can be compared to potential in gravitational field (Difference in height is a good analogy for difference in electrical potential)


**Analogy of circuit and power**

*Power = Current x Voltage*

Power (Watt)


# Basic Laws of (DC) Electrical Circuits

1. Ohm's law
2. Kirchhoff's Laws
3. Thevenin's Theorem


## Ohm's law

- Definition of (ideal) resistance ($V = RI$)
- Practical "resistors" behave close to the relationship above, but not exactly the same

### Resistors

## Kirchoff's law
