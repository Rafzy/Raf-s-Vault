# Introduction to data science

## What is data science?

Statistics -> Math
Statistics + Python -> Data analyst
Statistics + Python + Modelling -> Machine Learning
Statistics + Python + Modelling + <u>Domain Knowledge</u> -> Data Science

Domains in data science:
- Fraud & Risk detection
- Healthcare
- Internet search
- Advertising
- Government
- And many more

**What is data science**
Field that utilizes statistical and computational methods to extract insights from data. 
Combination of math, statistic, Domain knowledge, and computer science to analyze complex dataset.

**Importance of dataset**
The amount of data for businesses to process and analyze is growing exponentially, and businesses and organizations are looking to leverage this massive amount of data.

Data science -> <u>Identify patterns & trends</u> in big data, <u>make predictions</u>, and inform <u>decision making processes</u>

## Data Science Process overview

Involves systematic process of collecting -> processing -> analyzing -> interpreting data

Start by: defining the question or problem to be answered -> Data collection & cleaning, EDA, and modeling, once the model has been developed, we evaluate it, and refine it as necessary.

For the process of data science, we can use **OSEMN Framework**

1. **Obtain** -> Gather data from various sources
2. **Scrub** -> Clean and organize data for further use (handling missing data, etc)
3. **Explore** -> Use methods to find patterns and trends to understand the data
4. **Model** -> Make use of machine learning algorithms to gain useful insight
5. **Interpret** -> Draw meaningful conclusion and make simplified result.

## Tools and Techniques in Data Science

We use a wide range of tools and techniques to handle data, including machine learning algorithms, data visualization tool, and programming languages.



## Importance of Data Science for Human Behavior Analysis

Human behavior -> Potential & expressed capacity (mentally, physically, and socially) of human respond to internal & external stimuli

It is a complex interplay of three components: **Action, cognition, and emotion**

# Obtain

Human behavior is multimodal, we can gather inputs from:
- Facial expressions
- Gestures captured from images
- Video 
- Audio
- Etc

And there are many tools for collecting data like
- Observation
- Survey
- Online data crawling
- Cameras
- Microphone

## Human Behavior Recognition

> Aims to understand what people are doing by sensing and recognizing their activities and environments

Several aspects to categorize the human behavior recognition technology:
### Device Wise
1. **Vision**
	Vision based sensing, monitor user behaviors and environmental changes, ex: camera 
2. **Sensor**
	Use sensor network technologies that often come in a form of wearable sensors (Etc our phone is actually a sensor as well)
3. **Device free**
	Sense human behavior without the need to carry tags or devices (Pressure, infrared, ultrasonic, radio frequency, wifi)

### Human Wise
1. **Individual**
	Personal awareness, reaction/response from an individual
2. **Group & Community**
	Social interaction, response from a group rather than an individual

### Tech wise
1. **Pattern based**
	Uses an algorithm that can detect specific patterns
2. **Model based**
	Builds a complete representation of the system, requires a bigger dataset.


## Experimental Design Process

Research question (Hypothesis) -> Design experiment -> Collect data -> Analyze data -> Draw conclusion -> Repeat

### Research Question (Hypothesis)

> Use experiments to learn something new, to answer questions or to prove theoretic assumptions.

- Define research question -> Start with a general question, identify a problem, set a hypothesis
- Define target group -> C
