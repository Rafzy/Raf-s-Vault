# Introduction to data science

## What is data science?

Statistics -> Math
Statistics + Python -> Data analyst
Statistics + Python + Modelling -> Machine Learning
Statistics + Python + Modelling + <u>Domain Knowledge</u> -> Data Science

Domains in data science:
- Fraud & Risk detection
- Healthcare
- Internet search
- Advertising
- Government
- And many more

**What is data science**
Field that utilizes statistical and computational methods to extract insights from data. 
Combination of math, statistic, Domain knowledge, and computer science to analyze complex dataset.

**Importance of dataset**
The amount of data for businesses to process and analyze is growing exponentially, and businesses and organizations are looking to leverage this massive amount of data.

Data science -> <u>Identify patterns & trends</u> in big data, <u>make predictions</u>, and inform <u>decision making processes</u>

## Data Science Process overview

Involves systematic process of collecting -> processing -> analyzing -> interpreting data

Start by: defining the question or problem to be answered -> Data collection & cleaning, EDA, and modeling, once the model has been developed, we evaluate it, and refine it as necessary.

For the process of data science, we can use **OSEMN Framework**

1. **Obtain** -> Gather data from various sources
2. **Scrub** -> Clean and organize data for further use (handling missing data, etc)
3. **Explore** -> Use methods to find patterns and trends to understand the data
4. **Model** -> Make use of machine learning algorithms to gain useful insight
5. **Interpret** -> Draw meaningful conclusion and make simplified result.

## Tools and Techniques in Data Science

We use a wide range of tools and techniques to handle data, including machine learning algorithms, data visualization tool, and programming languages.



## Importance of Data Science for Human Behavior Analysis

Human behavior -> Potential & expressed capacity (mentally, physically, and socially) of human respond to internal & external stimuli

It is a complex interplay of three components: **Action, cognition, and emotion**
