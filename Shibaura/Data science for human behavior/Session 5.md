# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

> Approach of analyzing datasets and summarizing their characteristics

1. Variables
	Characteristics or attribute that can assume different values
	Divided into:
	- Numerical (Quantitative)
		- Discrete (Countable)
		- Continuous (Measurable)
	- Categorical (Qualitative)
		- Nominal (Unordered)
		- Ordinal (Ordered)

2. Distribution
	How often all possible values occur
	We can visualize distributions, and four types of distributions often seen in experimental data:
	- Constant distribution
	- Gaussian Distribution (Most of the observations cluster around the central peak)
	- Skewed distribution
	- Bimodal distribution

3. Descriptive vs inferential statistics
	- Descriptive statistics
	  Uncovers general pattern or trends of data (Mean, Mode, Median, etc)
	- Inferential statistics
	  Draw conclusion and make prediction (T-Test, ANOVA, Correlation analysis, Linear regression)

4. More advanced data analysis tool (SPSS, R)

5. Hypothesis Testing
	Draw conclusions for entire populations given a select sample
	One sided hypothesis & Two sided hypothesis

"Is the result significantly different?"

## Significance level testing

1. Fixed significance level testing
	When performing a test, there are 2 types of error:
	$\alpha$ = P (type I error) $H_{0}$ is rejected when it is true (False positive)
	$\beta$ = P (type II error) Fail to reject $H_{0}$ when it is false (False negative)
	
	In general, $\alpha$ (significance level) is specified in the procedure of testing.
	Usual threshold is 0.05 (There is a 5% risk of deciding an effect exists when it doesn't)

2. P-value approach
	Give more value to the weight of evidence against $H_{0}$ (The smallest level of significance that would lead to rejection of $H_{0}$)
