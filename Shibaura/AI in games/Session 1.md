# Introduction to AI

Purpose of AI:
- Improve human thinking by utilizing computers
- Understand how humans think

Applications for example Handwriting recognition, application in robotics, speech synthesis and recognition, games, and many more

Challenges of AI back then:
- Need extensive knowledge
- Need of perceiving the world
- Complexity of problems

**Problem of scalability**
Solving problems require search in a large space, like a game of chess may require searching by examining many2 nodes.

**Strong AI vs Weak AI**
Strong AI -> AI that is capable of doing multiple tasks, tries to imitate human mind
Weak/Narrow AI -> AI specialized for specific tasks (Chess, etc)

**Symbolic vs Sub-symbolic AI**
Symbolic AI -> High level symbolic representation of problems
Sub-symbolic AI -> Raw data are used to recognize patterns and build a knowledge out of it

**GOFAI**
Symbolic representations of problems, logic and search

**Connectionism**
Knowledge is represented by interconnected network of units (Something like neural networks) to emulate how the human brain learn.

How do we measure how good an AI is? => Turing test

**Chinese room argument**
Being able to answer correctly doesn't signify intelligence

**Moravec's paradox**

- It's easy to make a computer exhibit human like performance
- But it's impossible to make machine have the abilities of perception and mobility of a 1-year old

Moving around, paying attention, motor skills, etc -> Have evolved for millions of years
Unrelated to our body, mathematics, engineering, logic, etc -> Only have appeared for a few thousand years

**Learning vs Programming**

Programming a set of instructions may hit a roadblock when encountering a complex problem.
Example: Email filter

Learning is a big part of AI, it allows adaptation for different problems, environments, etc.
Humans & Animals -> Gets data from senses, and extract the rules of behavior.

Humans cannot change the body's configuration, but our brain changes as it's defined by learning.

The sudden improvement of AI is contributed by the huge amount of data made accessible by the internet.
With data, we can find patterns in even seemingly random data.

Extracting relevant data from a large volume of data -> **Data Mining**

**Machine Learning** -> from data, we let the computer "learn" and generate an algorithm

Data (Features) -> Learning -> Result (Prediction)

What happens in learning -> Mostly mathematics (LMAO)
