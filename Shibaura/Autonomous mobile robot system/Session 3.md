**Acceleration sensors**
Sensor that calculate's a target's acceleration and it's attached to the measurement target. 
For example, the acceleration sensor is used for robot orientation.

**Capacitance type acceleration sensor**
Inside this type of acceleration sensor, there are inertial mass and capacitor, and the capacitance will change according to the amount of change interval between capacitors.
