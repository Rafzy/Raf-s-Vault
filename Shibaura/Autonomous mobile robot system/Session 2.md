# Piezoelectric Vibration Gyro Sensor

Device that measures angular velocity (rate of rotation), utilizing the piezoelectric effect (The ability for a material to generate electricity when mechanically stressed *Piezein comes from the greek word meaning "to squeeze" or "to pass"*). 

In gyroscopic applications, this property is leveraged to detect rotational motion, typically through the **Coriolis effect** -> effect where nearby mass moving in a rotating system experiences a force (Coriolis force) acting perpendicular of motion and to the axis of rotation 



# Optical rotary encoder

Can detect the number of rotations of the axis
