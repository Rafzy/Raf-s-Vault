PSD work on the photovoltaic effect (generates voltage and electric current of a material when exposed to light). In this device, when light hits the detector surface, it generates photocurrents, and the position of the light can be determined by measuring how the current is distributed across the detector's surface. We can use two types of PSD: 1 dimensional PSD where we determine the position along a single axis, or two dimensional PSD, which can determine X and Y coordinates simultaneously.
