Good afternoon sir, we have pretty sad news, last week we consulted to SSC after getting sir hidayat as reviewer, turns out reviewer is not the same as supervisor, but it's very likely that assigned reviewers will end up as the supervisor for our thesis project, and after asking SSC, we also found out that ko ocin isn't eligible to become our supervisor in the administration side T-T, so it's basically impossible for you to officially become our supervisor and have your name in our paper. Rather than having to gacha our supervisor, we ended up asking sir hidayat to become our supervisor, it's really unfortunate since we really wanted you to become our supervisor, thank you so much for your help up until now with preparing our proposal.
