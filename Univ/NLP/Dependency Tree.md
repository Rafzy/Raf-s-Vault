# Clausal Argument Relations

1. **NSUBJ (Nominal Subject)**
	A noun phrase (or pronoun ) that serves as the syntactic subject of the clause
	Example: *She* eats apples (nsubj = "she")
2. **DOBJ (Direct Object)**
	A noun phrase that is directly affected by the action of the verb 
	Example: She eats *apples* (dobj = "apples")
3. **IOBJ (Indirect Object)**
	The noun phrase that is indirectly affected by the action of the verb (Usually the recipient)
	Example: She gave *me* a gift (iobj = "me")
4. **CCOMP (Clausal Complement)**
	A dependent clause that has it's own subject (Can be different from the higher clause's object)
	Example: She said that *she was leaving* (ccomp = "she was leaving")
5. **XCOMP (Open Clausal Complement)**
	A dependent clause missing it's own subject where the subject is controlled by the higher clause
	Example: She wants *to leave* (xcomp = "to leave", the understood subject of "to leave" is "she")


# Nominal Modifier Relations

1. **NMOD (Nominal Modifier)**
	A nominal or prepositional phrase serving as a <u>modifier</u> of a noun
	- Example: The book *on the table* is mine (nmod = "on the table", modifying book)
2. **AMOD (Adjectival Modifier)**
	An adjective modifying a noun
	Example: She bought a *red* car (amod = "red")
3. **NUMMOD (Numeric Modifier)**
	A numeric word or phrase modifying a noun
	Example: She bought *three* apples (numod = "three")
4. **APPOS (Appositional Modifier)**
	A noun phrase that directly follows and renames or further identifies another noun phrase
	Example: My friend, *sarah*, is here (appos = "sarah", in apposition to "friend")
5. **DET (Determiner)**
	Articles of words like "the", "a", "this", "those", etc.
	Example: *the* cat is sleeping (det = "the")
6. **CASE (Case Marker)**
	Prepositions, postpositions, and other case markers
	Example: I walked to the store (case = "to")
7. prep (Preposition)
	I guess similar to case, but this one is specifically for prepositions like "with", "by", etc

# Other Notable Relations

1. **CONJ (Conjunct)**
	A word or phrase that is part of a coordiation (Two parallel elements joined by a conjunction)
	Example: She bought apples and *oranges* (conj = "oranges", connected to "apples")
2. **CC (Coordinating Conjunction)**
	The coordinating junction itself 
	Example: She bought apples *and* oranges (cc = "and")



# Projectivity

Additional constraint derived from the order of the words in the input

- An arc from a head to a dependent is said to be **projective** <u>if there is a path from the head to every word that lies between the head and the dependent in the sentence</u>
