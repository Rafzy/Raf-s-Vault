> Chatbots aim to mimic the properties of human conversation, and use the available knowledge to take turns conversing with a hooman

**Dialogue Systems properties:**
- Taking turns (On top of this, the dialogue systems must also detect when a user is done speaking like using endpointing or endpoint detection)
- Speech act
	Each utterance in a dialogue is a kind of action performed
	Divided into 4 classes:
	- Constatives (Commiting the speaker to something's being the case)
	- Directives (Attempts the speaker to get the addressee to do something)
	- Commissives (commiting the speaker to some future course of action)
	- Acknowledgements (Express the speaker's attitude regarding the hearer)

> Grounding -> Acknowledging that the hearer has understood the speaker

**Dialogue Structure**

adjacency pairs composed of first part and second part give systems expectations to help them decide what action to take, given an input from a user

QUESTIONS -> ANSWERS
PROPOSALS -> ACCEPTANCE/REJECTION
COMPLIMENTS -> DOWNPLAYERS

However there can be sequence in between the adjacency pairs


**Initiative**

Conversational initiative -> The one that controls the conversation
Conversations can have mixed initiative


**Chatbots** -> Programs that participate in turn taking conversations
