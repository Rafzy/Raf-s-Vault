# Introduction

> We will learn how operating systems are designed and developed


**Definition**
Software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, providing an interface between the user and the machine. It exploits the hardware resources of one or more processors of a computer

# Main structure

1. Processor -> CPU
2. Main memory -> RAM
3. I/O -> Keyboard, mouse, monitor
4. System Bus -> Transports data


## Processors

Processor controls the operation of the computer, and usually it's referred to as a central processor unit


## I/O Modules

Move data between the computers and external environments, allows the user to interact with what's going on with the computer
Ex:
- Secondary memory devices
- Communication equipment
- Terminals

# Instruction Execution

A program consists of a set of instructions stored in memory

Processor reads instructions from memory -> processor executes each instruction

**Example:**

## Interrupts

- Mechanisms by which other modules may interrput the normal sequencing of the processor
- This is done to provide improvement for processor utilization
	- Most I/O Devices are slower than the processor
	- The processor must pause to wait for the device
	- Wasteful use of processor


**Classes of interrputs**

1. Programs
	Generated by some condition that occurs as a result of an instruction execution.
2. Timer
	Generated by a timer within the processor. This allows the OS to perform certain functions on a regular basis. Example: Clock, timer, etc
3. I/O
	Generated by an I/O Controller, to signal normal completion of an operation
4. Hardware failure
	Generated by a failure, such as power failure or memory parity error


**New instruction cycle with interrupts**

**Multiple interrupts**
-> An interrupt that occurs while another interrupts is being processed
How to handle:
- Disable interrupts while processing an interrupt
- priority scheme



## Memory Hierarchy

1. Register (The fastest)
2. Cache
3. Main memory
4. Outboard memory (SSD, HDD, Magnetic disk, CD)
5. Offline storage



**Principle of locality**

> The tendency for a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time

- The memory referenced by the processor tends to cluster
- Data is organized so that the percentage of accesses to each successively lower level is substantially less than the levels above



### Main memory
- Stores data and programs
- Volatile
	- memory is lost when computer is shut down
- Referred to as main memory or primary memory

### Secondary memory
Also referred to as auxiliary memory
- External
- Nonvolatile
- Used to store permanent program files and data

### Cache memory
- Invisible to OS
- Interacts with other memory management software
- Processor must at least access once per instruction cycle


# Operating System

> A program that controls the execution of application programs, it acts as an interface between applications and hardware

Main objective:
- Convenience
- Efficiency
- Ability to evolve

**Operating System services**
1. program development
2. program execution4
3. Access I/O Devices
4. Controlled access to files
5. System access
6. Error detection and response
7. Accounting

# System batch System

**Job control language**

1. Special type of programming language used to provide instructions for the monitor
2. What compilers to use
3. What data to use

# System Calls

- The interface between user programs and the OS is primarily about dealing with abstractions.
- The system calls available in the interface may vary from one OS to another.
- A system call is invoked from C programs by calling a library procedure with the same name as the system call
