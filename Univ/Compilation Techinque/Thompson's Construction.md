#compilationtechnique 

>Thompson's construction is a technique used in the field of compilation to convert a regular expression into a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). It is particularly useful for lexical analysis, where regular expressions are used to define the patterns of tokens in source code, and an automaton is built to recognize these tokens.
